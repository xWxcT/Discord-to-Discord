# File: bot.json

Example of how your configuration file should look like with the channels and their respective webhooks.

```json
{
    "discord": {
        "token": ""
    },
    "channels": {
        "Channel Id": "Webhook URL",
        "12345": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/12345/XXXXXxxxXXXXX"
    }
}
```

You can add as many channels as you prefer as long as your machine supports it.
